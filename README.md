# README.md
hello!
i'm tristan petrovich, this is my public GitHub profile!
i will post here irregularly if i'm working on things i feel are decent enough to put next to my name

currently:
* IDEA DROUGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :( i WANT to make something cool but i have no clue where to start yet.
* minus that i'm working on something fairly large for practice
* i also wanna learn C#, java, or haskell soon, since haskell is unique and C#/java i can use for game development and modding :D

i know C/C++, python, and i sometimes use x86 (intel) assembly but i don't like to actively use it for things when i don't NEED to
i'm 14, american, and bday is 2/28/2011
